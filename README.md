# Image Clustering

## Description

This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive project on image clustering, which is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The project explores various techniques commonly used in this domain, including traditional methods like K-means clustering, as well as state-of-the-art approaches like VGG for feature extraction.

## Project Modules

The project is divided into the following modules:

- Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for image clustering.
- Input: A large set of images and the target number of clusters (N).
- Output: N sets of images generated using a suitable clustering criterion.
- Utilizes VGG/ResNet for image feature extraction.
- Visualizes images within each cluster to demonstrate their proximity to each other.

## Dataset

For training and testing, we have chosen an RGB image dataset with a minimum of 100 classes, ensuring a diverse and challenging dataset for evaluation.
